# Aigis UI test plan

This plan describes black-box console sessions for `aigis.Aigis`. Every input
line is one command sent to a fresh process with an isolated working directory.
Expected output is an exact stdout transcript, including the startup banner and
closing message.

Run the plan from the project root with:

```text
python .codex/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py --plan test/ui-test-plan.md
```

- Main class: `aigis.Aigis`
- Java requirement: Java 25 (`java` and `javac`)
- Failure policy: stop immediately after the first failed test case

## Test case 1: Exit immediately

Aim: Verify that Aigis starts with no data file and closes cleanly when the user enters `bye`.

Inputs:

```text
bye
```

Expected output:

```text
      __        __     _______   __      ________  
     /""\      |" \   /" _   "| |" \    /"       ) 
    /    \     ||  | (: ( \___) ||  |  (:   \___/
